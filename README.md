##OpenVSM - Redux##

This fork of Pugnator's OpenVSM was created by me just as a cleanup of the code and Visual Studio's project files.<br>
The objective of this fork is only to make OpenVSM cleanly buildable on Visual Studio 2015 (and later).

The folder arrangement was modified to my preference, just to make it easier to integrate with other projects I have on the same filesystem.

I have also modified the Makefiles to make it cleanly buildable using TDM-GCC-W32 under a msys2 environment.

The Lua version was also updated to the latest 5.3.3.

Other than these changes, there is no other change to the code, and it is exactly the same as Pugnator's original.

To obtain documentation and more information on how to use OpenVSM, please visit Pugnator's GitHub page.<br>
See also the LICENSE file for licensing details.

All the credit for writing OpenVSM goes to Lavrentiy Ivanov.
